Welcome to my site, I'm starting a blog about things that interest me, things
I've learned, and just random thoughts that come along. I'm a software engineer
and I've worked on platforms ranging from avionics, to .NET, to web dev with
Python and Ruby. Hopefully I can pass on some knowledge and interesting tidbits
along the way. Stick around and we'll have some fun.

I'm experimenting with different technologies and wanted to try something new so
this site is being hosted on GitHub pages using
[Octopress](http://octopress.org/). Next up, styling and getting this to look a
bit less early 2000's.
